# My-CPPlusPlus-Projects
My all C++ algorithm projects in one Repo. Details in the Readme

## Project 1 - 3D Primitives (with dynamic face, vertex and division counts which can change with +/- and other keys)

Main fines that i worked on - MyMesh.cpp (drawing 3D shapes using algorithms and Math), AppClassMain.cpp (event binding, input processing etc) and AppClass.cpp (Initializing everything)
Everything else is included in order to understand how things are rendered, what is VAO and VBO, Vertex shaders and OpenGL system. I also learnt about these while programming the 3D Primitives.
