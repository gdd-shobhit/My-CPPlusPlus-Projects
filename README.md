# My-CPPlusPlus-Projects
My all C++ algorithm projects in one Repo. Some of the projects have OpenGL Shader code which I had to read and understand where to put my code to successfully implement the projects.

# Engine Related Projects

## Project 3 - Octree (Directly relates to Engine Optimization)

An Awesome project directly relates **Collision**, **Optimized Rendering** and **Displaying LOD at the right moment**.

Through Octree one can optimize rendering easily as we can tell the camera to render a particular part when it collides with a 'node' in the Octree. This is how LODs can be put in place and taken out. Engine optimization can also be a big part of Octree.

# Algorithm based C++ Projects

## Project 1 - 3D Primitives (with dynamic face, vertex and division counts which can change with +/- and other keys)

Main fines that i worked on - **MyMesh.cpp** (drawing 3D shapes using algorithms and Math), **AppClassMain.cpp** (event binding, input processing etc) and **AppClass.cpp** (Initializing everything)
Everything else is included in order to understand how things are rendered, what is VAO and VBO, Vertex shaders and OpenGL system. I also learnt about these while programming the 3D Primitives.

## Project 2 - Camera Controls

A project on programming the movement of camera which can be used in an Engine. Used vectors and math to manipulate the directions.

It can go - Vertical, Sideways, Forward and Free motion (no-clip for games) when middle mouse/ right mouse is clicked.
